1.Question 1
Suppose I define the following function in R
cube <- function(x, n) {
        x^3
}
cube(3)

Answere : 27

2.The following code will produce a warning in R.

x <- 1:10
if(x > 5) {
        x <- 0
}

Answere : 
'x' is a vector of length 10 and 'if' can only test a single logical statement.

3.Consider the following function

f <- function(x) {
        g <- function(y) {
                y + z
        }
        z <- 4
        x + g(x)
}
z <- 10
f(3)

Answere : 10

4.Question 
Consider the following expression:
x <- 5
y <- if(x < 3) {
        NA
} else {
        10
}

Answere : 10

5.Question 5
Consider the following R function

h <- function(x, y = NULL, d = 3L) {
        z <- cbind(x, d)
        if(!is.null(y))
                z <- z + y
        else
                z <- z + f
        g <- x + y / z
        if(d == 3L)
                return(g)
        g <- g + 10
        g
}

Answere : f

6.Question 6
What is an environment in R?

Answere : a collection of symbol

7.Question 
The R language uses what type of scoping rule for resolving free variables?

Answere : Lexical Scoping 

8.Question 
How are free variables in R functions resolved?

Answere :
The values of free variables are searched for in the environment in which the function was defined

9.Question 
What is one of the consequences of the scoping rules used in R?

Answere : all Objects must be Stored in memory 

10.Question 
In R, what is the parent frame?

Answere : It is the environment in which a function was called
